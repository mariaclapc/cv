<h1>dreams</h1>
<p> I have many dreams actually, but my two most important dreams are.</p>
<p>1. I want to have a family when Im older I want to have 3 kids two big boys and 1 girl. I know It may be hard to achieve this but I want to become a millionaire and I want to be really succesfull, and I wanna give my children the live my parents
  couldn’t.</p>
<p>2. I want to be a doctor, either a dermatologist a plastic surgeon or a, really good lawyer. But I have a lot of more options.</p>
<hr>
<h1>pets</h1>
<p>
  I already mentioned my dog earlier, she is a small extremely cute yorkie, yorkies are usually really mad dogs, and they don’t like kids. But Mia loves kids she couldnt hurt anyone. She is really calm she loves to sleep and to play with her toys.
  She loves to be touchy and like to cuddle with my dad and in general with everyone of my family. a fact of her is that when there are thunders she gets scared and goes under the beds.</p>

<p>I live with my mom, my dad and my brother. I want to start off by telling you about my brother.</p>
<p>Martin: Martin is a 12 year old boy. He studies in Aspen Alcazares. He likes playing games in his computer, he plays cars games and he really likes airplanes. He recently started going out with his friends and he is enjoying it a lot. He is my
  best friend I tell him everything, although I he stresses me a lot and I get mad with him really frequently, but deep down I love him.</p>
<p>Mi mom Ana Maria: she is an ingenier, she has one sister and one brother, she loves reading. She believes a lot of the universe, she believes in the angels and all of that stuff. she is actually studing a masters degree, and shes moving to costa
  rica for 3 months!</p>

<h1>reccomendations</h1>
<p>a place to go to: i would highly recomend go to cartagena or to san andres, the beach there is extreamly pretty, the climate is just perfect, and in cartagenas case gping to see the Ciudad amurallada is really good at night.</p>
<p>a great restaurant is capitulo, the food is great there and the service as well, the architecture and decoration there is stunning.</p>
<p>some series i would highly recomend would be sin senos si ahi paraiso, that is a colombian novel, and elite that is a spanish series.</p>
